# Task description

## Overview
In this project, you will build an end-to-end e-commerce platform using Spring Boot microservices on the backend and Angular on the frontend.
Users can register as clients or sellers; sellers manage products and related media (images).

You will practice service decomposition, inter-service communication and a clean Angular UI that consumes these services.

## Role Play
You are a full-stack engineer designing a small but realistic marketplace composed of independently deployable services.
Your mission: deliver a secure, observable, and scalable platform where clients browse products and sellers manage their catalog and media.

## Learning Objectives
Design and implement Spring Boot microservices (User, Product, Media)

Apply asynchronous communication (e.g., Kafka) where appropriate

Implement JWT or OAuth2 with Spring Security for role-based access

Enforce secure file uploads with validation and size limits

Model and persist data in MongoDB (or polyglot where justified)

Build an Angular SPA with routing, guards, interceptors, and forms

## Instructions
### 1) Microservices Setup
Create separate services:

User Service (auth, profiles, roles: CLIENT, SELLER)

Product Service (CRUD for products, image references)

Media Service (image upload/download, validation, 2 MB limit)

Configure Kafka (optional but recommended) for events such as PRODUCT_CREATED, IMAGE_UPLOADED (useful for audit, cache invalidation, thumbnails).

### 2) Enhanced Database Design

```
┌─────────────────────────┐        ┌─────────────────────────┐        ┌─────────────────────────┐
│         Media           │        │        Product          │        │          User           │

                                   │ + String userId         │        │   (client/seller)       │
                                   └─────────────────────────┘        │ + String avatar         │
                                                                      └─────────────────────────┘
```

**Entity Relationships:**
- **Media** `has` **Product**: One-to-many relationship where each media item belongs to a specific product
- **User** `owns` **Product**: One-to-many relationship where each user (seller) can own multiple products

### 3) API Development Enhancement
**User Service**

Auth: POST /auth/register (role: CLIENT | SELLER), POST /auth/login → JWT/OAuth2 token

Profile: GET /me, PUT /me (seller may upload/update avatar → delegated to Media Service)

**Product Service**

Public: GET /products (list), GET /products/{id}

Seller-only: POST /products, PUT /products/{id}, DELETE /products/{id} (enforce ownership)

Associate imageUrls[]; uploading images is performed via Media Service then linked here.

**Media Service**

POST /media/images (seller-only): validate MIME type (image/*) and ≤ 2 MB

GET /media/images/{id}: serve image (with proper caching headers)

Optional: DELETE /media/images/{id} (seller must own media)

All services expose /actuator/health; gateway routes external traffic and applies cross-cutting filters (CORS, auth propagation, rate limiting if added).

### 4) Front-End Development with Angular
**Auth Pages**: Sign-in & Sign-up (role selection). Sellers can upload/update avatar.

**Seller Dashboard**:

Manage products (create/edit/delete) and attach images (preview, remove).

Show validation messages (price > 0, required fields).

**Product Listing (Public)**:

Simple grid/list of products (no search/filter required).

**Media Management**:

Dedicated view to upload/manage images for the seller's products.

Enforce file type/size in the UI before calling the API.

**Technical**

Use route guards (AuthGuard, RoleGuard), HTTP interceptors (attach token, handle 401/403), Reactive Forms, and Angular Material/Bootstrap for responsive UI.

### 5) Authentication & Authorization
Spring Security with JWT or OAuth2 at the gateway and propagated downstream.

Roles: CLIENT (browse) vs SELLER (manage own products/media). ADMIN (optional) for moderation.

Enforce ownership checks in Product/Media services (sellerId == auth.subject).

### 6) Error Handling & Validation
Return meaningful status codes:

400 invalid input / file type / file too large

401/403 unauthenticated/unauthorized

404 not found (product/media not owned or missing)

Avoid unhandled 5xx via global exception handlers.

Angular: show inline form errors; display toast/snackbar for upload failures, oversized files, or forbidden actions.

### 7) Security Measures
HTTPS end-to-end (e.g., Let's Encrypt for certs).

Password Security: hash+salt with BCrypt in User Service (never expose password).

Input Validation: validate filenames/MIME; verify content by sniffing headers; reject non-image payloads.

Access Control: only the creating seller can modify/delete a product or its images.

CORS: gateway enforces allowed origins and headers.

(Optional) Rate Limiting at the gateway for auth and media endpoints.

## Constraints
Backend split into at least 3 microservices (User, Product, Media) + Gateway + Discovery.

MongoDB for persistence; images stored in object storage (not in DB).

Public endpoints: product GETs; all write operations require auth and role checks.

Media uploads: image/* only, max 2 MB; reject others.

Provide a comprehensive README with run scripts (Docker Compose encouraged).

## Evaluation
⚙️ Functionality: Role flow works; sellers can CRUD products & images; clients can browse.

🔐 Security: JWT/OAuth2, password hashing, ownership enforcement, CORS.

🧩 Architecture: Clean service boundaries, gateway & discovery configured, optional Kafka events.

🚫 Reliability: Proper error handling (no unhandled 5xx); health checks.

🎨 UX: Angular app is responsive, guards/interceptors implemented, clear validation.

## Audit
### Initial Setup & Access:

#### Download the project and initiate it using docker. Try accessing the web pages and the API endpoints using a web browser and tools like Postman.

- Does the application run seamlessly, and are you able to interact with its functionalities?

### User & Product CRUD Operations

#### Examine the CRUD operations for Users (both client and seller) and Products.

- Are CRUD operations for Users and Products correctly implemented, and does each user role have the appropriate access levels?

### Authentication & Role Validation

#### Sign up as a client and a seller. Afterwards, test functionalities specific to each role.

- Does the authentication system work, and do the operations respect the user roles (seller vs client)?

### Media Upload & Product Association

#### As a seller, attempt to upload media for a product and ensure it adheres to the given size and type constraints.

- Can media be uploaded effectively, and are the constraints enforced? Are products correctly associated with these media?

### Frontend Interaction

#### Explore the sign-in/up pages, seller product management page, product listing, and media upload page for products.

- Are all the frontend pages functioning as expected, and is the user experience intuitive?

### Security

#### Analyze for the specified security measures like hashed passwords, input validation, protection of sensitive data, and HTTPS usage.

- Are the mentioned security practices appropriately enforced?

### Code Quality and Standards

#### Evaluate the backend code for appropriate usage of Spring and other related annotations.

- Are the Spring Boot, MongoDB, and other relevant annotations used correctly throughout the application?

### Frontend Implementation

#### Investigate the frontend codebase, especially the Angular components, services, and modules.

- Is the Angular code structured efficiently, and are components, services, and modules effectively utilized?

### Error Handling & Edge Cases

#### Attempt actions that might cause errors, such as registering with an existing email, uploading invalid media formats, or exceeding the media size limit.

- Does the application gracefully handle these errors, providing useful feedback to the user?
