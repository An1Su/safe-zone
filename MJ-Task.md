# Task description

## Overview
In this project, you will set up a Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline using Jenkins for your e-commerce microservices platform.  
This pipeline will automatically build, test, and deploy your application, ensuring consistent and reliable delivery.

## Role Play

You are a DevOps engineer responsible for automating the development workflow of your e-commerce platform.  
Your mission is to build a robust Jenkins pipeline that fetches the latest code, runs automated tests, deploys the project, and notifies the team of build statuses.

## Learning Objectives

- Set up and configure Jenkins  
- Implement CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins Jobs  
- Integrate automated testing for backend and frontend  
- Automate build, test, and deployment stages  
- Implement notifications and basic rollback strategies  
- Apply best practices in automation and deployment  

## Instructions

### 1. Setting Up Jenkins

- Download, install, and configure Jenkins.  
- 💡 Hint: Use Jenkins official documentation or Docker to set up Jenkins.  
- Set up build agents if necessary.

### 2. Create a CI/CD Pipeline for Your E-commerce Platform

- Create a Jenkins job that fetches the source code from your Git repository (e.g., GitHub).  
- Set up build triggers to initiate a build automatically whenever there’s a new commit.

### 3. Automated Testing

- Integrate automated testing into your pipeline.  
- 💡 Hint: Use JUnit for backend testing and Jasmine/Karma for Angular frontend testing.  
- Ensure the pipeline fails when a test fails.

### 4. Deployment

- Automatically deploy your application to a server or platform of your choice after successful builds.  
- Examples: AWS, Heroku, or a local server.  
- Implement a rollback strategy in case a deployment fails.

### 5. Notifications

- Set up email or Slack notifications to inform team members of build status (success or failure).

## Constraints

- The pipeline must automate the entire process from build → test → deploy.  
- Failures in any stage should stop the pipeline.  
- Notifications must clearly indicate build and deployment results.  
- The system should support rollback in case of deployment errors.

## Evaluation

Your CI/CD setup will be assessed on:

- ⚙️ **Automation**: Proper and automatic code fetching and build triggering  
- 🧪 **Testing Integration**: Correct handling of automated tests and failures  
- 🚀 **Deployment**: Reliable and repeatable deployment process  
- 🔔 **Notifications**: Accurate and timely build and deployment updates  
- 🧩 **Pipeline Quality**: Clear structure, proper stage configuration, and maintainability  

- (⭐ Bonus) Effective use of parameterized and distributed builds

## Bonus Features (Optional but Recommended)

- **Parameterized Builds**: Allow customization of parameters (e.g., environment selection) for each build run  
- **Distributed Builds**: Use multiple build agents for parallel or multi-environment builds  

## Resources

## Audit
### Functional

#### Download the project and trigger a Jenkins build. Observe if the pipeline runs as expected.  
  - Does the pipeline initiate and run successfully from start to finish?

#### Trigger some intentional build errors and observe Jenkins' response.  
  - Does Jenkins respond appropriately to build errors?

#### Examine the automated testing step.  
  - Are tests run automatically during the pipeline execution?  
  - Does the pipeline halt on test failure?

#### Make a minor change in the source code, commit, and push. Observe if the pipeline is triggered automatically.  
  - Does a new commit and push automatically trigger the Jenkins pipeline?

#### Check the deployment process.  
  - Is the application deployed automatically after a successful build?  
  - Is there a rollback strategy in place?

### Security

#### Examine the permissions on the Jenkins dashboard.  
  - Are permissions set appropriately to prevent unauthorized access or changes?

#### Review how sensitive data (like API keys, passwords) is managed in Jenkins.  
  - Is sensitive data secured using Jenkins secrets or environment variables?

### Code Quality and Standards

#### Examine the Jenkinsfile or the build configuration.  
  - Is the code/script well-organized and understandable?  
  - Are there any best practices being ignored?

#### Look into the test report formats and outputs.  
  - Are test reports clear, comprehensive, and stored for future reference?

#### Check for notifications setup.  
  - Are notifications triggered on build and deployment events?  
  - Are they informative?

### Bonus

#### Examine if parameterized builds are implemented.  
  - Are there options for customizing the build run with different parameters?

#### Examine the distributed builds (if implemented).  
  - Are multiple agents utilized effectively for distributed builds?
